# A very basic chat app
This is a very simple chat app I made using  _socket.io_ and _express_.

### How to setup
- Clone this repository
- Then run the following command: `npm install`
- After installing the node modules, run `node index.js`
- This is running on localhost. Copy the link to open the app on your browser
- Everytime you open a tab to the chat using the previous link, it will be consider as a new user
- You can open as many tab as you want
- to stop the server, just use `Ctrl-C`


___I am open to any suggestion to improve this little project___
